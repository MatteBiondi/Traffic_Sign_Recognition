# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

Keras/Tensorflow implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address the traffic signs classification problem.

## Project Goals

The objective of the project is to implement models capable of classifying road signs with an acceptable accuracy (at least accuracy â‰¥ 90%, higher is better) but with a reduced size compared to state-of-the-art models. In particular, the number of
parameters that make up the model will be taken as a complexity metric. Finally, completely customized solutions will be compared with solutions based on the use of pre-trained networks. The solutions will be analyzed from the point of view of different metrics.
